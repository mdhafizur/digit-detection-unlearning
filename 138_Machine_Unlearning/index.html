    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Author: Karan Dhanawade
    </p>

    <p>
      This section introduces the concept of machine unlearning, highlighting its importance in ensuring ethical data
      practices and compliance with privacy regulations.
    </p>
    <h3>1.1 Overview and Importance</h3>

    <p>
      "Machine learning has become a ubiquitous technology, influencing everything from product recommendations to fraud
      detection systems" <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. This power, however, comes with the responsibility of ensuring ethical
      data practices. Large datasets used to train ML models can inadvertently capture and store personal information.
      This necessitates a new approach to data management, balancing the need for model efficacy with user privacy.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Regulatory Mandates: The Right to be Forgotten</h3>

    <p>
      The "Right to be Forgotten" is a crucial aspect of modern privacy regulations, most notably embodied in the
      European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. This regulation, which came into
      effect in May 2018, represents a significant step forward in giving individuals control over their personal data.
      It empowers individuals to request the deletion of their data from organizational databases, ensuring that their
      personal information is not retained longer than necessary. GDPR has profoundly impacted how organizations handle
      data, setting a high standard for privacy practices globally. Many countries have adopted similar regulations to
      protect their citizens' data. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States
      provides similar rights to individuals, allowing them to request the deletion of their personal information and
      ensuring transparency in data handling practices. Applying the "Right to be Forgotten" to machine learning models
      presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional databases, where data points can be easily identified and removed,
      ML models embed information in a complex, interwoven manner. When an ML model is trained, it captures patterns and
      relationships from the data, making it difficult to isolate and remove the influence of specific data points
      without affecting the model's overall functionality. Real-world cases illustrate the challenges and necessity of
      this regulation. In 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled in favor of Mario Costeja González, who requested
      Google to remove links to newspaper articles about his past financial troubles. This landmark case highlighted the
      importance of the "Right to be Forgotten" and set a precedent for future regulations. Data breaches at companies
      like Facebook and Equifax underscore the need for robust data protection practices and the ability to erase
      personal information upon request. Compliance with GDPR and similar regulations involves ensuring that ML models
      trained on this data no longer retain any residual information. This is where the concept of machine unlearning
      becomes critical. It provides a framework for selectively removing data from models, ensuring compliance with
      privacy laws while maintaining the integrity and functionality of the models.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 The Challenge of Data Retention in ML Models</h3>

    <p>
      The very nature of ML models presents another hurdle. These models learn and adapt over time, continuously
      refining their predictions based on new data. This ongoing learning process makes it difficult to isolate and
      remove the influence of specific data points, especially for models trained on massive datasets <a
        href="#r3">[3]</a>. Additionally, completely retraining an ML model can be a resource-intensive and
      time-consuming process.
    </p>

    <h3>1.4 Emergence of Machine Unlearning</h3>

    <p>
      In response to these challenges, the field of machine unlearning (MU) has emerged. MU focuses on developing
      techniques to selectively remove specific data points or their influence from a trained model, essentially
      allowing the model to "forget" irrelevant or outdated information. This enables us to comply with regulations like
      the Right to be Forgotten while preserving the functionality of the model <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2 Background</h2>
    <p>Author: Md Hafizur Rahman</p>
    <p>This section provides an extensive overview of machine unlearning, clearly defining the concept and outlining its
      essential components and motivations.</p>
    <h3>2.1 Definition and Conceptual Framework</h3>
    <p>
      "Machine unlearning can be broadly defined as the deliberate process of removing the influence of specific data
      points or their associated information from a trained ML model" <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. This process allows the
      model to essentially "forget" irrelevant or outdated information, thereby improving its adaptability and ensuring
      compliance with stringent privacy regulations <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. Here is a conceptual framework illustrating
      the key elements of machine unlearning (cf. figure 1):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Initial Training Phase:</strong> On the left, a set of images (including those of different individuals)
        is used to train a model, creating a pre-trained model. This process is depicted by the blue dashed line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Forget Set:</strong> A subset of the training data, referred to as the "forget set" (highlighted with a
        red border), is identified. This subset consists of the data that needs to be forgotten or removed from the
        model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unlearning Algorithm:</strong> The pre-trained model, along with the forget set, is fed into an
        unlearning algorithm (illustrated with an eraser). This algorithm modifies the pre-trained model to produce an
        "unlearned model," which no longer retains the information from the forget set.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gold Standard:</strong> Separately, a new model is trained from scratch using the same original data but
        excluding the forget set. This results in a gold standard model (depicted in green), representing what the model
        should ideally look like if the forget set had never been included in the training data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparison:</strong> The unlearned model (produced by the unlearning algorithm) is compared to the gold
        standard model. The comparison assesses "How close are these models?" to determine the effectiveness of the
        unlearning process.
      </li>
    </ol>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>2.2 Motivation and Objectives</h3>
    <p>The motivations for machine unlearning are multifaceted and significant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Privacy Compliance:</strong> Regulations such as GDPR empower individuals to request the deletion of
        their data. Machine unlearning facilitates compliance by enabling models to "forget" such data while maintaining
        their functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Model Adaptability:</strong> Real-world data is dynamic, with outdated or irrelevant
        information becoming burdensome over time. Machine unlearning allows models to adapt by forgetting such data,
        potentially enhancing their performance on new, unseen data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Safety and Security Concerns:</strong> In safety-critical applications (e.g., self-driving cars), biased
        or erroneous data can lead to dangerous outcomes. Machine unlearning can help mitigate these risks by removing
        the influence of such problematic data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Ensuring that models do not retain data that subjects have chosen to
        delete supports ethical data practices and respects individual privacy rights.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3 Machine Unlearning Methods and Approaches</h2>
    <p>
      Author: Md Hafizur Rahman
    </p>

    <p>
      This section explores various techniques and algorithms used for machine unlearning, including data perturbation,
      model retraining, and algorithmic modifications.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Overview of Existing Techniques</h3>

    <p>
      Machine unlearning encompasses a range of techniques designed to enable models to forget sensitive or outdated
      data. These techniques can be broadly categorized into three main approaches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Perturbation:</strong> This approach modifies the original data to reduce its memorability by the
        model. Techniques include adding noise, scrambling data points, or applying differential privacy mechanisms <a
          href="#r4">[4]</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Model Retraining:</strong> This approach involves retraining the model on a modified dataset that
        excludes the data to be forgotten. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as data deletion,
        aggregation, or anonymization <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Algorithmic Techniques:</strong> This approach leverages algorithmic modifications to the learning
        process itself to enable forgetting. Techniques include synaptic pruning in neural networks, masking weights, or
        incorporating forgetting functions into the learning objective <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The choice of technique depends on various factors, including the type of data, the model architecture, and the
      desired forgetting guarantees <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Algorithms for Data Removal from ML Models</h3>

    <p>
      Several algorithms have been proposed for removing data from machine learning models while preserving model
      utility. Here are some key examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>SISA (Sharding):</strong> This approach involves partitioning the training data into smaller,
        non-overlapping subsets called shards. Multiple models are trained on these individual shards. When a data point
        needs to be forgotten, only the models trained on the shards containing that data point need to be retrained,
        rather than retraining the entire model. This reduces the computational cost of unlearning <a
          href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </li>
      <figure>
        <img src="sisa.png" alt="Concept of SISA Training" id="figure2" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 2</strong>: Concept of SISA Training <a href="#r5">[5]</a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>
        <strong>NTK (Neural Tangent Kernel):</strong> The Neural Tangent Kernel is a mathematical framework that
        approximates the behavior of neural networks during training. NTK-based methods can efficiently update the model
        weights to forget specific data points without requiring full retraining by leveraging the NTK approximation <a
          href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </li>
      <figure>
        <img src="ntk.png" alt="Concept of NTK Training" id="figure3" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Concept of NTK Training <a href="#r12">[12]</a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>
        <strong>SCRUB:</strong> This technique involves analyzing the gradients and updates associated with the data
        points during training and then "scrubbing" or subtracting their influence from the model's parameters. SCRUB
        effectively reverses the contributions of the data points to be forgotten <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning:</strong> This method addresses scenarios where no original training data
        is available for unlearning. Zero-shot unlearning can be accomplished using techniques like generating synthetic
        data that mimics the properties of the original data, leveraging generative models, or using other forms of
        auxiliary information <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.
      </li>
      <figure>
        <img src="zero-shot.png" height="400" alt="Concept of Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning" id="figure4" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Concept of Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning <a href="#r11">[11]</a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <li>
        <strong>Forgetting Factor (FF) based methods:</strong> These methods introduce a forgetting factor into the
        model's learning objective function, which gradually reduces the influence of past data points over time <a
          href="#r4">[4]</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Synaptic Pruning:</strong> Inspired by biological forgetting mechanisms, this technique removes or
        weakens connections (synapses) in artificial neural networks that are associated with the data to be forgotten
        <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Knowledge Distillation:</strong> This technique involves training a smaller model on the outputs of a
        larger model, effectively compressing the knowledge of the larger model while forgetting specific data points <a
          href="#r4">[4]</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The effectiveness of these algorithms depends on the specific implementation and the characteristics of the data
      and model <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.

    <h2>5 Evaluation and Metrics</h2>
    <p>Author: Md Hafizur Rahman</p>
    <p>This section covers the essential metrics and methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of machine unlearning,
      including data removal rate, model utility preservation, and privacy leakage assessment. These metrics are crucial
      for determining how well a machine learning model has managed to forget specific data points.</p>
    <h3>5.1 Metrics for Assessing Unlearning Effectiveness</h3>
    <p>Developing effective metrics to assess how well a model has forgotten specific data is an ongoing area of
      research. Here are some common metrics used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Removal Rate:</strong> This metric measures the percentage of data points that have been
        successfully removed from the model's memory <a href="#r5">[5]</a>. A higher data removal rate indicates a more
        effective unlearning process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Model Utility Preservation:</strong> This metric evaluates how well the model performs on the remaining
        relevant data after forgetting the target data points <a href="#r5">[5]</a>. This can be measured using standard
        accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score metrics depending on the application. Maintaining high utility while
        achieving unlearning is a critical balance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Privacy Leakage:</strong> This metric assesses the amount of information about the forgotten data points
        that can still be inferred from the model. Techniques like differential privacy analysis can be used to quantify
        this leakage <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. A lower privacy leakage score indicates better compliance with privacy
        requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The choice of metrics depends on the specific goals of machine unlearning in a particular application. Different
      applications might prioritize different aspects of unlearning effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Comparative Analysis of Unlearning Methods</h3>
    <p>Comparing the effectiveness of different machine unlearning techniques is essential for selecting the most
      appropriate approach for a given scenario. Here are some factors to consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Type of Data to be Forgotten:</strong> Different techniques might be more suited for forgetting specific
        data points, features, or entire datasets <a href="#r4">[4]</a>, <a href="#r5">[5]</a>. The nature of the data
        to be forgotten can significantly influence the choice of unlearning method.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Model Architecture:</strong> The underlying architecture of the machine learning model can influence the
        effectiveness of different unlearning techniques <a href="#r5">[5]</a>. Some methods may be more compatible with
        certain types of models than others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trade-off between Forgetting and Utility:</strong> There is often a trade-off between how much data is
        forgotten and how well the model performs on the remaining data. Different techniques might achieve varying
        levels of this trade-off <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. Understanding this balance is crucial for implementing effective
        unlearning.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Researchers are actively developing frameworks and benchmarks to enable systematic comparison of machine
      unlearning methods <a href="#r8">[8]</a>. These frameworks help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of
      various approaches under different conditions.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Challenges in Quantifying Unlearning Performance</h3>
    <p>Quantifying the effectiveness of machine unlearning presents unique challenges that need to be addressed for
      robust evaluation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Ground Truth Definition:</strong> Defining what constitutes "forgotten" data can be complex, especially
        when dealing with nuanced privacy concerns <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. Establishing clear criteria for what needs to
        be forgotten is critical for accurate assessment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Limited Observability:</strong> Unlike training data, forgotten data is no longer available, making it
        difficult to directly assess how well it has been removed <a href="#r5">[5]</a>. This lack of visibility poses a
        significant challenge for evaluation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Indirect Metrics:</strong> Metrics like privacy leakage rely on estimating the information an adversary
        can infer about forgotten data, which can be imprecise <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. Indirect measurements can
        introduce uncertainty into the evaluation process.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Researchers are exploring new approaches to address these challenges and develop more robust evaluation
      methodologies for machine unlearning. Innovations in this area will be crucial for advancing the field and
      ensuring that unlearning techniques are both effective and reliable.</p>
